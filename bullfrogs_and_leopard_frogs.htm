Both of these frogs are fantastic swimmers. Not all frogs are. In fact, frogs 
can drown. This is not the case with these two. They never venture far from 
water in nature and will submerge when they feel threatened. A frog may seem a 
bit clumsy out of water but when swimming, they are truly graceful and a 
pleasure to watch. My Leopard frogs and Bullfrog have swam in our pool when the 
chlorine level has been low. (It never seemed to hurt them but they didn't get 
to go in except on occasion.) They have also gotten to swim in the bath tub, 
especially since it was a good place for them to hang out while their tank was 
being cleaned. Besides, swimming is great exercise for these frogs.</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font size="2"> Housing them 
depends on their size. Both of these frogs are also expert at the high jump so 
screening is an absolute necessity! The Bullfrog can become as large as Pyxies so they need a very large tank and a very big bathing bowl. The 
Bullfrog would probably be happier in a pond. The Bullfrog is the frog that is jumped 
in competition at the Calaveras County&nbsp; Frog Jump held each May. The book by Mark Twain, <u>
The Famed Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</u> featured the Bullfrog. Leopard 
frogs and Bullfrogs can be housed together but you have to be alert for bullying 
(sorry, couldn't resist) and 
subsequent injuries and infections. With Bullfrogs, make sure they are the same 
size! Room mates are fair game when you're hungry and especially if your room 
mate is a lot 
smaller!</font></b></font><b><font size="2" color="#FFFFCC">&nbsp; </font></b> </p>

Both frogs of course like crickets dusted with Calcium and Vitamin D3 but the Bullfrog being 
bigger, will enjoy the occasional mouse too. Leopard frogs are quite prone to 
metabolic bone disease so Calcium&nbsp; on their crickets is very important. Both of 
these frogs are shy but the males are usually less so. It is easy to distinguish 
males since their ears (large circle behind the eye) is the same size or larger 
than their eye. The females ear is smaller. These frogs especially are not fond of 
handling and will do their best to discourage you with the usual methods; 
squirming, wetting and sometimes croaking indignantly. They can be friendly (for 
them) however, and 
I have had Leopard frogs who &quot;talked&quot; to me. In other words, they would croak and 
I would answer, I would talk to them and they would croak and so on for 
sometimes a few minutes at a time. And sometimes for no apparent reason, they 
seem to just want to hear themselves croak.</font></b></p>
