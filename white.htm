<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#003300" size="2">Here is 
Limey and Dudley. Both these frogs are brown...and green. Limey here is green 
and Dudley is still brown. Maybe Limey feels warmer. It's a temperature thing.&nbsp; They 
love their castle! Yes, their house is really a castle. They love to sit in the 
door of their castle surveying their kingdom. Just like a prince (or princess).</font></b></p>

White's tree frogs are fun frogs! They are very docile and friendly and seem not 
afraid of humans. They make a good first pet frog for that reason. They will 
ride on your shoulder but you can't be sure they will stay put. These frogs are 
housed in a 40 gallon tank with carpeting, a plant for ambience, a suitably 
sized bowl and of course their toad house. These frogs are said to like to climb 
and I have provided them with a sturdy stick but they never used it much 
preferring to hide in their toad house, sit in their plant, sit on a rock, sit 
on top of their toad house and once in a while climb on the glass of the tank. 
They don't always leave debris in their water so their carpeting is frequently 
changed and sent to the &quot;laundry&quot;. Fortunately I have accumulated extra 
carpeting so a quick change is always possible. </font></b></p>

White's (named for the person who discovered them) tree frogs are usually hearty 
eaters but do slow down a bit in the winter. They too are quite prone to 
metabolic bone disease and need Calcium dusted crickets for 
sure. In the cooler months they enjoy a light on their tank and will bask under 
it. They need a screen because without one, you could find your White's tree 
frog exploring your ceilings. With good care, these frogs have a life span of 
about 20 years. </font>
