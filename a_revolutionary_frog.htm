<p>All the little froglets were gathered around on lily pads waiting to hear the 
latest tale told by Grandma Frog. Froglets came from near and far. They looked 
forward every evening to hear the stories she told. She was the best story 
teller ever and her tales were known in swamps, creeks and ponds everywhere. So, 
they gathered every evening happily listening to a bed time story told by the 
one and only Grandma Frog. As they waited, the little froglets played froggy games 
like leap frog and a card game called Frog (similar to Fish but you are told Go 
Frog!) and naturally the cards are water resistant. Or, they just visited among 
themselves catching an occasional fly or mosquito. </p>

<p>Before long Grandma Frog arrived. You didnt have to see her to know she had 
come. There was a gigantic splash and she settled herself on a very, very big 
lily pad. Grandma Frog ate lots and lots of crickets and bugs so she needed quite a 
big lily pad. She looked out over the crowd of froglets, smiled (frogs are 
always smiling, you know), took her spectacles from her apron pocket and after 
placing them on, she said,</p>
<p>&quot;The better to see you, little ones. Are you ready for a story?&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0153008[1].gif" width="80" height="99"></p>
<p>The little froglets went wild! Yes! Yes! Were ready, they croaked. Some 
little froggys were so excited they jumped up and down on their lily pads 
splashing water all over.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/NA01035_[1].gif" width="194" height="93"></p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; said Grandma Frog. &quot;Do you know how important frogs are?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the froglets told her. &quot;Are we really important, Grandma Frog,&quot; asked 
Stanley.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my yes,&quot; Grandma Frog told them. &quot;Why some frogs have shaped history!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="/web/20030914143842im_/http://www.frogdaze.com/images/j0091083[1].gif" width="80" height="169"></p>
<p>&quot;Really,&quot; the froglets asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes indeedy,&quot; Grandma Frog told them. &quot;Now tonight I am going to tell you a 
true story about a very famous frog. His name was George Washington Frog. He 
lived at the same time as the very first president of our country, George 
Washington. Its not clear if George Frog was named for George the president or 
whether George the president was named for George the frog. We frogs of course 
prefer to believe that the president was named for George the frog but it 
doesnt really matter. The important thing is that George Washington Frog helped 
George Washington, who was then a general during the Revolutionary War.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was the Revolutionary War,&quot; asked Herbert.</p>
<p>&quot;When the people first came here, they were ruled by England, a country very 
far from here, way across the ocean. Things were fine for a while until the 
English started making the people here do things they didnt want to do like pay 
big taxes, taking a percent of everything they earned. The colonists (the 
people here) decided they didnt want to be ruled by England anymore and wanted 
to be free and start their own country. But England didnt want them to be free 
and so they were fighting about it. The colonists threw Englands tea in the 
harbor (tea is big in England, you know) because they didnt want to pay taxes on it. Frogs 
of course were here long before the people and as you know, frogs are very 
peaceful. Many frogs and people became good friends. George Frog and George 
Washington were friends and would often spend a summer evening together talking 
and enjoying each others company. But all the arguments between the colonists 
and the English caused them to fight. George Washington 
Frog didnt really care about fighting but since he was good friends with George 
Washington, he was loyal to him. He didnt like it that sometimes the English were 
mean to the colonists so he could understand why they wanted to be free.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were mean,&quot; asked Phineas Phrog.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0125465[1].gif" width="80" height="84"></p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they were,&quot; answered Grandma Frog, &quot;and the people got fed up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did they do,&quot; the froglets all called out.</p>
<p>&quot;They decided then that they would declare their independence,&quot; Grandma Frog 
told them.</p>
<p>&quot;How did they do that,&quot; asked Byron Bullfrog, a very studious frog and quite 
interested in history.</p>
<p>&quot;On July the 4<sup>th</sup>, the colonists wrote the Declaration of 
Independence which said they wanted to be free of England and be their own 
country,&quot; Grandma Frog told them.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0125467[1].gif" width="80" height="90"></p>
<p>&quot;And then they were free,&quot; a little girl froglet asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; Grandma Frog told her. &quot;You see, by writing the Declaration of 
Independence, the people were telling England they were even willing to go to 
war against them to be free. So, the English sent lots of soldiers dressed in 
red uniforms to fight the rebels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rebels?&quot; The froglets did not understand what that word meant.</p>
<p>&quot;They were rebels because they wouldnt do what the English wanted. It means 
someone who wont do what is expected of them. Like a froglet who wont eat his 
crickets or play nicely with other froglets.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0153008[1].gif" width="80" height="99"></p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; The froglets understood. They all knew some rebel frogs and sometimes 
they werent very nice.</p>
<p>&quot;But in this case, that was alright to be a rebel because they were fighting a good 
cause, to be free and live like they wanted to,&quot; Grandma Frog informed them.</p>
<p>&quot;And that is what the Revolutionary War was about,&quot; asked Bob Bullfrog.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and thats where George Washington Frog comes in. George Washington, 
the person, was made general of the rebel army and he had to make sure they won. 
Mostly he did a fine job but one very important time he needed George Washington 
Frogs advice and because the general listened, it made a big difference in the 
outcome of the war.&quot; Grandma Frog paused in her tale to catch a fly.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/an_frog1.gif" width="136" height="81"></p>
<p>The froglets were all excited. They couldnt wait to hear how a frog helped 
win the Revolutionary War! But they waited patiently while Grandma Frog gulped down 
her snack.</p>
<p>&quot;General George Washington planned to cross a river with his troops to 
surprise the English, win the battle and hopefully the war. But he made a bad 
decision about which river to cross,&quot; Grandma Frog told the froglets.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it he chose the wrong river, Grandma Frog,&quot; asked Leonard. &quot;He was a 
general and very smart, wasnt he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes indeed! But sometimes we make mistakes no matter how smart we are,&quot; Grandma 
Frog said. &quot;And this is why George Washington Frog saved the day!&quot;</p>
<p>The froglets squirmed around on their lily pads with anticipation. Here comes 
the good part! How a frog changed history! They were so excited and proud to be 
a frog!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/NA01035_.gif" width="194" height="93"></p>
<p>Grandma Frog dipped her spectacles into the pond and dried them on her apron. 
After examining them to make sure they were clean by holding them up to the 
light, she put them back on and looked at the froglets. She smiled at them and 
chuckled. She knew they couldnt wait to hear how a frog saved the day and when 
she saw that they couldnt stand the suspense any longer, she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;General George had planned to cross the Potomac River and was getting ready 
to do this when George Frog heard about it. But he cant cross there, he 
thought. I must warn him! George Frog commenced hopping toward General Georges 
camp near the Potomac River. He hoped he would get there in time so he hopped 
and hopped just as fast as he could. He didnt even stop once for a fly or bug 
along the way!&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/SO01185_[1].gif" width="80" height="78"></p>
<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; exclaimed Albert Amphibian. Albert was a rather plump frog, 
always fly catching and he couldnt imagine not stopping for a fly or bug. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0125397[1].gif" width="90" height="87"></p>
<p>&quot;Was it very far,&quot; asked Ann Phibian.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it was,&quot; replied Grandma Frog. &quot;But everything is within hopping distance 
you know. Besides, George Frog could not let his friend George the general make 
a mistake that could lose him the war.&quot; </p>
<p>Grandma Frog reached into the pond at the edge of her lily pad, scooped up a 
tiny froglet treading water, placed him on her generous lap and continued her 
story.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0106470[1].gif" width="100" height="86"></p>
<p>&quot;George Frog hopped and hopped and hopped! It seemed like forever! He was 
hungry and very tired but still he hopped and hopped and hopped. At long last he 
reached General Georges camp. Exhausted, he gave one last hop and landed at 
General Georges feet. General George looked down at his frog friend in 
amazement.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that you, George Frog,&quot; he asked. &quot;You are very far from home. Have you 
hopped all this way?&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0111576[1].gif" width="80" height="119"></p>
<p>George Frog was so tired, he could only croak weakly. General George picked 
him up and placed him gently on his bed. Kneeling beside him, he asked his aids 
to bring water because he knew George Frog liked water (as all frogs do, of 
course) and he hoped that would help him. He was quite worried about his frog 
friend since he had never known him to croak so weakly before but he knew if his 
friend had traveled so far to see him, there must be a very important reason.
</p>
<p>The aid returned with a dish of water and General George lovingly placed his 
friend in it. General George feared it was too late. He was afraid that George 
Frog had tired himself out so much with all his hopping over so great a distance 
because George Frog just lay quietly and limply in the water without so much as 
a croak.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0150345[1].gif" width="100" height="64"></p>
<p>&quot;Was he dead,&quot; asked Polly Wog, tearfully.</p>
<p>&quot;My goodness, no! He couldnt have become a famous frog had he died,&quot; Grandma 
Frog assured her. &quot;No, he was fine. He was just very tired and needed a minute 
or two in the water to revive. Soon, he felt better and stronger. George Frog 
sat up, hopped onto General Georges lap as he always did when they visited with 
each other. General George was much relieved. He cared a lot for George Frog but 
he could tell his frog friend was quite concerned. He asked George Frog what the 
matter was and what was so important that he had hopped so far to see him&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;George! George! Dont go into the Potomac! Dont do it! Ive been in the 
Potomac and believe me! You dont want to go there! Besides, it isnt the right 
river!&quot; George Frog was hopping up and down on General Georges lap, quite 
upset.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0111582[1].gif" width="100" height="89"></p>
<p>&quot;But you know I have to cross the river to win the war. It will surprise the 
enemy,&quot; General George told him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know, George. But not the Potomac! Please! Not the Potomac! Its the 
wrong river!&quot; George Frog was frantic.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/j0084346[1].gif" width="100" height="102"></p>
<p>&quot;The wrong river?&quot; General George looked out over the Potomac River. It 
looked harmless to him and he could have sworn the enemy was on the other side.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, George. The wrong river. You need to cross the Delaware River! We frogs 
have been doing our patriotic duty as you requested, spying on the enemy, since 
you know that few people pay much attention to a frog hopping about.<img border="0" src="images/AN00466_[1].gif" width="80" height="81"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw the enemy camped on the other 
side of the Delaware River!&quot; George Frog hoped General George would listen to 
what he had to say. Even though they were best friends, George Frog realized he 
was still just a frog and maybe General George would think a frog could not know 
the best river to cross or tell the difference between the English and the 
colonists. After all, George Frog had often told General George he could hardly 
tell people apart. They sort of all looked alike. So, he waited while General 
George thought about it. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/AN00817_[1].gif" width="82" height="65"></p>
<p>&quot;My friend, I trust you. If you say we must cross the Delaware, then that is 
what we shall do! I thank you from the bottom of my heart that you hopped all 
this way to prevent me from making such a big mistake,&quot; General George said.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/frog%20with%20flipper%20up.gif" width="110" height="165"></p>
<p>&quot;And so, General George gathered his troops and they headed north toward the 
Delaware River. They gave George Frog a ride and let him huddle under warm 
blankets because it was winter and what do frogs do in the winter,&quot; asked Grandma 
Frog.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Hibernate!&quot; The froglets all knew about hibernating to keep warm in the cold 
winters. They couldnt imagine a frog hopping about in the dead of winter! 
George Frog was truly a very brave frog!</p>
<p>&quot;Thats right. George Frog was very cold because normally he would be 
hibernating but since General George needed his help, he didnt burrow under the 
mud that winter. It was so cold, even General George and his troops were 
shivering and almost freezing! So, you can imagine how a frog must have felt.&quot; 
Grandma Frog caught a mosquito but wasted no time gulping it down before finishing 
her story.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/AN03932_[1].gif" width="150" height="97"></p>
<p>&quot;General George crossed the Delaware River and the rebels won the war. They 
were free. There are pictures of General George in a boat with his troops as he 
crossed the river. And that, my dear little froglets, is how a frog became 
famous during the Revolutionary War and changed history. If the rebels had lost 
the war, why, this country might still be ruled by England.&quot; </p>
<p>The froglets were quiet thinking about that.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/AN00817_[1].gif" width="80" height="63"></p>
<p>&quot;Now I am getting very hungry. A fly now and then is not much of a dinner. Go 
hunt for bugs now, little froglets. I will see you tomorrow and tell you about 
more famous frogs,&quot; Grandma Frog said as she slid off her lily pad into the water.</p>
<p>All the froglets jumped into the water, catching bugs as they swam away. All 
that is, except one little froglet who swam over to Grandma Frog.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0126489[1].gif" width="80" height="80"></p>
<p>&quot;Grandma Frog?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; Grandma Frog enjoyed her dinner immensely but never enough to not answer 
a froglet.</p>
<p>&quot;Was George Frog in the boat with General George,&quot; the little froglet asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He certainly was! The general insisted his frog friend be there by his side 
when he crossed the Delaware River since he wouldnt have been crossing the 
Delaware, but the Potomac, had it not been for his frog friend.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;And was George Frog in the picture of General George in the boat,&quot; the 
little froglet asked.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j0084348[1].gif" width="80" height="84"></p>
<p>Grandma Frog patted the froglet on his head. &quot;Yes, he was. People cant see him 
unless they look very closely. Frogs of course can see him just fine.&quot;</p>
