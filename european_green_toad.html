and known for his tanks. Sherman looks like he's wearing fatigues so he just had 
to have a distinguished military name. Pictured here its obvious Sherman has 
gotten the best of his opponent. This is our first toad so we're getting to know 
each other. We can say we like him very much. Hope he feels the same. Not a lot 
of differences in care. He loves to eat, crickets, worms, flies and especially 
wax worms although too many are fattening and not a lot of &quot;good&quot; nutrition but 
are great for a treat. He hides in his toad house most of the day but comes out now and then 
to check things out. He soaks in his &quot;pond&quot; at least once a day.
