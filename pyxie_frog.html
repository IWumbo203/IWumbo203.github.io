&nbsp;<b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2">This is 
Webster, the largest frog in the bunch!&nbsp; Big, green, mean, eating machine!</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp; </font></b></p>

Webster is a Pyxicephalus Adspersus, his scientific name, otherwise known as an 
African burrowing bullfrog. (Comes from Africa) Burrowing, because they like to dig into the 
dirt/substrate. Giving him a sandbox to burrow in will delight your Pyxie. And 
not only that, it's good for them because it's good exercise and keeps those 
powerful legs strong. Other wise, Webster lives in a 20 gallon tank with his big 
house, a big bowl and washable carpeting. These frogs will probably slow down on 
their eating in the winter months when they are adults. The babies however, will 
continue to gobble up anything that moves, including room mates, so be cautious 
about housing them together. </font></b></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font size="2">This is Cornelia (Corny), 
Webster's girlfriend. She is about half his size.  
Corny has the same basic setup as Webster, just smaller. Her picture is small, 
but you can click on it and make it larger to see Corny better.</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyxies can grow quite large, 7 to 8 inches in length or so. Webster weighs about 
2 pounds or more and came home the size of a silver dollar. He is now about 8 
inches long while Corny is about 5 inches long. So you can see, 
these are no <i>pixies</i>! Males are larger than the females which is one way to tell 
them apart. A Pyxie father will protect his babies, unique for frogs. When you 
bring a baby Pyxie home, he may be hyper and shy wanting only to burrow and 
hide. However, once they settle in after a few days or so, they don't mind being 
out and about. The babies will snap at anything that moves and are always 
hungry. These frogs eat mice as well as crickets, worms and anything else they 
can catch. As the Pyxie grows, he will need a bigger and bigger tank and bowl to 
accommodate his rapidly increasing size.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
