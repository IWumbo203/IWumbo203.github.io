Despite all your good care, your amphibian could still get sick or injured. What 
do you do? First of all, you need to determine if your frog or toad is in fact 
sick. If you observe your web footed friend and know his normal behavior, any 
unusual behavior may tip you off that he or she needs your help. Having provided 
a good home to many different types of frogs over many years I have tried to become alert 
to signs a frog needs help. These are some of them. The most important thing is 
to know your frog or toad and distinguish normal behavior from behavior that is not 
normal. In nature, amphibians try not to show that they are sick because 
weakness makes them easy prey so when they do demonstrate unusual behavior or 
signs of illness, they could be very sick. </font></font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; Some symptoms that could 
indicate a problem<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">(These are some but there could be others 
depending on the condition and any of these should be associated with other 
symptoms)</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Usually, the first sign of 
trouble is that a sick or inured frog will stop eating. This is not always the 
case of course because your frog or toad may slow down on his eating because its 
that time of year or some other reason known only to your amphibian. An amphibian during &quot;hibernation&quot; 
for instance, can reduce his metabolism 
to almost nothing and need no food during this time. But, if this is not the 
case, and a formally healthy, hungry amphibian refuses the delicious food you 
offer him, then he may be in trouble. This is a judgment call on your part since 
you as the human who cares for him (or her as the case may be) will know your 
amphibians normal behavior best and what time of year it is. Try a variety of 
food. He may be bored with the same thing. If you think his eating is a sign he 
is sick, take a stool sample to the vet for microscopic examination. If your 
frog isn't making messes, you may need to take the whole frog. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Another early sign 
of a problem is that your amphibian is listless. Most frogs and toads are 
not keen on you bothering them and will react by jumping away or some other form 
of behavior which indicates they disapprove of your attempts of affection. 
Naturally there are times you must handle them but if your frog or toad hardly 
reacts to your ministrations, he may be feeling sick. And of course difficulty 
moving is a sure sign something is wrong.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Soaking much more than normal. 
An amphibian in dire straits seem to head for water when they are not feeling 
well. While amphibians love to soak which is of course how they drink, excessive 
bathing is unusual. This is especially true of tree frogs who bathe at night 
being the nocturnal creatures that they are, but return to their leaves when 
morning comes to rest or sleep the day away. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Obviously if your amphibian is 
injured, you will notice that right away. Perhaps they hurt themselves during 
their night time escapades or on some rough object in their home. Open wounds, 
deformed legs etc. will be something you will see right away when you give them 
your exceptional room service every day. Its a good idea to check on your frog 
or toad every day since they like to hide from us. However, much to their 
possible displeasure, its a good idea to make sure they are doing well during 
your room service routine. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Finding tree frogs on the 
floor of their tanks often or even all the time is not a good sign. Tree frogs 
like to be off the ground and up high in their tank, either adhered to the glass 
or on their leaves unless they are bathing or hunting. If they spend most of the 
time on the ground or all the time, they may not be feeling well and too weak to 
climb. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">5. Color may alert you to a 
problem. If you notice that a frog or toad is pale or darker than normal, this 
may be a sign all is not right with your amphibian. Its probably not always easy 
to notice this but in a red eyed tree frog for instance, their normally 
brilliant green may get dark or even mottled in coloration. Don't however, 
mistake this for blending in with their background. A red eye for instance, will 
look darker on dark leaves and lighter on light leaves. And they are lighter 
when warm and darker when cool. This too is a judgment call and has to be 
associated with other symptoms. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Reddened belly and legs may be 
a symptom of the dreaded Red Leg, a particular nasty disease in amphibians. It 
will appear reddish and irritated looking, not just a little pinkish which could 
be okay. You will know if this is there. It's not pretty. Gently press on the 
reddened area. If it stays red when you take your finger away, this may be a 
sign of infection. If its just irritation from rubbing, the area where your 
finger was pressing will be light colored like the frog or toads belly when you 
take your finger away.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">7. Sores or blisters on the body 
will of course easily alert you that your amphibian has something nasty going 
on.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">8. Yawning constantly. Amphibians 
as you've not doubt noticed, open their mouths to eat but usually don't go 
around yawning even if sleepy. This could indicate that they are having trouble 
breathing and a sign of Spring Disease, a particularly nasty amphibian disease.
</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">9. No more messes to clean up. 
While this may be nice for you, this is not good for your amphibian. He or she 
needs to eliminate waste and not doing so can cause him to become toxic. Not 
only that, your amphibian recognizes on some level that part of what goes in 
will eventually have to come out and so he will stop eating. He or she could 
have a blockage of his intestinal tract which means nothing is going to move 
very well. A word of caution about pebbles and small rocks in the enclosure 
where your amphibian resides. Don't. A frog or toad may snatch up a small rock 
and not be able to pass it and cause a blockage which probably can only be 
resolved by surgery.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">10. Bloating. Amphibians often 
blow themselves up to discourage their enemies from preying on them. Obviously 
you aren't going to intentionally hurt them but its a natural instinct. However, 
they deflate themselves when the danger of you looking at them when they aren't 
in the mood passes. But an amphibian that is constantly blown up may be 
retaining too much water (edema) and something is wrong.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">11. Cloudy eyes or blood in them. 
Certainly blood in your amphibians eyes is cause for concern. He may have hurt 
his eye but it is a sign also of a generalized infection. Cloudy eyes may be the 
result of too much fat in his diet. Domestically raised crickets can cause this 
because of their diet or too many mice. Not much can be done for cloudy eyes.</font></b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">What to do if you think your frog or 
toad is sick or injured</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all 
don't try medicating your frog with human medicines. They can be toxic to your 
amphibian.&nbsp; The best thing of course is to prevent illness. You do this by 
providing a clean environment by cleaning and changing water every single day if 
possible. There may be times when you take a vacation for a day or so but do 
your best to change their &quot;ponds&quot; every day with de-chlorinated water. A friend 
or relative might tend to your charges while you are away. Removing messes from 
their homes is important too, as you undoubtedly know. Bacteria breed when 
unclean conditions are present. Regular super cleaning of their homes should be 
done often. This requires taking out the amphibian and all his or her 
'furniture' and giving everything including the tank a good washing. If the tank 
smells of ammonia, its definitely time for house cleaning! If all of your 
preventative measures haven't worked and despite all your hard work, amphibians 
may still get sick or injured. Unless you yourself are a professional in the 
care of amphibians, call an exotic veterinarian (one who specializes or 
regularly treats amphibians and other unusual pets) to assess your amphibian and 
provide medical care. It's a good idea to have one of these vets identified 
prior to your frog or toad's becoming sick. It will be no fun to have to find 
one when you're in a panic because your amphibian needs help NOW! This is not to 
say that you should rush your amphibian off to the vet with any change in 
behavior. Common sense is important and your ability to pay is of course another 
important factor. </font></b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking your 
amphibian to the vet requires a carrier of some sort that will be such that a 
nervous amphibian cannot jump out of. An appropriately sized plastic creature 
tank can be found at pet stores for just this purpose. Or a pillow case 
especially for larger frogs or toads will work. Put the pillow case in a plastic 
bag but don't close it. This helps to prevent messes that may occur en route due 
to the amphibians nervousness at riding in your spanking clean vehicle. </font>
</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like your 
own human doctor, be sure you like and trust your vet. Try to meet him or her 
before you need their services so you feel confident they are proficient and 
understand amphibians. Don't be afraid to question them about the care of your 
frog or toad and request another opinion if you feel something radical is being 
suggested for your flippered friend. A good vet will not be offended and in fact 
should welcome a second opinion since no one person can know everything and 
another vet may be more knowledgeable about your frog or toad's particularly 
unusual condition. You would want the same for your human loved ones and 
yourself. Your amphibian is your responsibility and you should be included in 
decisions regarding his care and feel comfortable knowing you are providing the 
best medical care you can. However, because they are exotic vets, they will most 
likely know how to treat your pet frog or toad and provide the appropriate 
treatment. </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking your 
frog or toad to the vet can be an expense you weren't counting on when you 
brought that adorable amphibian home but in doing so, you made an unspoken 
commitment to him or her that you would do your best to provide a good home and 
adequate medical care if necessary. After all, he had no choice in the matter 
and is trusting you to take care of him to the best of your ability. If your 
friend has been with you for many years (depending on the amphibian since they 
have different life expectancies), sad as it may be, you may decide to let 
nature take its course and allow your amphibian to pass on without the heroics 
which can be very stressful. As his caretaker, you must after all, make that 
judgment call. If you decide its best to let him go, make him as comfortable as 
possible, continue to love him until the end and after your friend is gone, 
remember the pleasure he or she gave you. </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">Still not sure whether your frog or toad 
needs help?</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2">There 
are exotic vets who will consult with you on line. For professional advice and 
guidance here is one web site you can go to and ask for a on line consultation for 
a modest fee. I think you will find Dr. Rhines for example, very helpful and 
informative with questions you have about the particular problems you may 
be experiencing with your amphibian.&nbsp; Contact him at
