Be sure you know what is involved before bringing an unsuspecting amphibian 
home. Let's face it. He is at your mercy so be kind to him (or her as the case 
may be) and know your frog's needs so when you get him home, he feels at home 
too. Well, as much as a frog can be at first. Remember. As potential princes and 
princesses, frogs want to think of their new habitats as the castles they 
expect.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although your 
frog will be your pet of course, unlike furry pets, most frogs dislike being 
handled very much. In fact, you may notice that they squirm and yes, even wet on 
you, especially initially when you are trying to get to know your frog better. 
This wetting is your frog's way of telling you this stresses him. Make sure he 
gets to bathe after you've handled him so he can replenish the water he has lost during this 
getting acquainted session. Some frogs will always act this way. Plain and 
simple, they do not want to be handled. Some frogs, on the other hand, will at 
least<img border="0" src="images/holding%20webster.jpg" width="200" height="126" align="left"> &quot;tolerate&quot; you after they settle into their new environment since 
maybe they 
realize it's merely an annoyance and not a real threat. After all, you do feed 
them and perhaps on some level, they figured this out. In any case, observing 
your frog will be fun enough (at least for the frog) but when you do handle him, 
which of course you will on occasion in order to tend to him, wash your hands 
before and after. Before, because the salt on your hands is irritating to him 
and after, because despite the fact that your frog will bathe regularly, it's 
still the sanitary thing to do. And one last thing. Be careful picking them up. 
Should they squirm and you're not prepared to hold him firmly but gently, the 
frog could fall, hurt himself and you will feel lower than pond scum.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cute little 
frog you discovered in your neighborhood pet store could grow up to gigantic 
proportions! Plan accordingly as he grows. A plain old fish tank without all the 
pumps and filters etc will do quite nicely for a frog. And sometimes bargains 
can be had on leaking tanks which obviously won't work well for fish but will 
be just fine for a frog. Baby frogs will be happy in a small tank, 5 or 10 gallon 
size but will need to be transferred to larger quarters as they grow because of 
the great job you will be doing feeding them regularly. A screen for the frog's 
tank will be a necessity for<img border="0" src="images/the%20toadhouse.jpg" width="150" height="139" align="right"> jumping or climbing frogs or else you may find them 
exploring your home instead of their own. This is not good because it could be 
dangerous for the frog and not very hygienic for you. Which is why it is a good 
idea to provide a screen (in most cases) to prevent your charges from escaping. 
Also, it's not a bad idea to give your frog a light so he will be warm in the 
winter and the UV type to give him the benefits of sunlight he doesn't get in 
his tank. Unless of course, you plan to take him regularly outside to bask in 
the sun. If you do, take him in his tank and let him get about 20 minutes every 
other day. This is not always convenient so in the end, a light is usually the 
better choice. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All frogs 
regardless of type, can be accommodated with some sort of indoor outdoor 
carpeting (can be found in pet stores) or paper toweling, a bowl (appropriate to 
the frog's size) to bathe in and a house of some type (like a half of a flower 
pot for example) to hide from you now and then, depending on the frog of course. 
Frogs are by nature shy so they need a hiding place or they become stressed. How 
would you like to be stared at constantly? </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good 
hygiene is necessary for frogs just like it is for us. Since they cannot 
manipulate the faucets in your home to bathe regularly, as they are prone to do, 
you must provide suitable bathing facilities in their home. Actually, a frog 
will utilize his bath tub for drinking too. All frogs drink through their skin 
so they need clean (preferably de-chlorinated) water available to them when they 
feel the need to bathe or drink. They will sit in their &quot;ponds&quot; and soak up 
water which<img border="0" src="images/an%20frog%20bathing.gif" width="90" height="114" align="left"> they usually do at night. The water bowl must be changed at least 
every day because they often leave debris behind which is pretty nice of them 
when you think about it. If the debris is in the bowl (easily discarded), then 
carpeting won't have to be washed as often or paper toweling changed as much. 
Very few frogs are housebroken. I personally have never met a frog who was, so 
their droppings must be removed regularly. Let's face it. You wouldn't want to 
sit around your house with frog droppings all over either. Besides, it's healthier 
for them too because frogs can get sick from unsanitary conditions which can 
breed nasty bacteria. Keeping your frog's home simple will make it easier for 
you to provide a clean healthy environment for which your frog will thank you. 
Trust me. He will, even if he doesn't actually say so. You will know because he 
will thrive.</font></b></p>

<b><font face="Times New Roman"> 
&nbsp;Frogs 
are not fond of veggies and you can't buy frog food at the grocery store. A frog 
prefers live food or food he thinks is alive. Most frogs enjoy crickets and many 
pet stores sell crickets. Gathering them in your back yard is not a good idea 
since the outdoor cricket is prone to pest sprays and no self respecting frog 
wants to eat a chemical laden cricket! Besides, it's not healthy for your frog 
not to mention that your neighbors will wonder what you're up to. Frogs will 
also eat worms, flies and other assorted bugs and crawly things but I doubt 
you'll find too many pet stores supplying a variety of bugs. Earth worms can be 
found in some pet stores and certainly at fishing supply stores. Remember to 
dust the crickets with Calcium every day. You can use Calcium with Vitamin D3 
but not too often. According to my vet, the D3 can cause the Calcium to be 
absorbed too much and is not good for your frog. But you can dust the crickets 
with it maybe every other week or once a month but in general, just dust with 
plain old Calcium. And to make sure your frog (or toad) gets proper nutrition 
from their food, grind up some dry dog food for them to eat before you feed the 
crickets to your amphibian. The nutrition in the </font></b>
<font face="Times New Roman"><b><img border="0" src="images/AN00469_[1].gif" width="150" height="110" align="right">dog 
food will be in the cricket when your frog eats it.</b></font></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larger frogs 
will simply adore a mouse now and then. Not too often because even frogs can get 
fat and its not healthy for them anymore than it is for you. Frozen mice (much 
more humane) are available at many pet stores too. Naturally the frog will want 
you to defrost it first! Hot water for a short time works fine.&nbsp; Since the 
mouse is dead, you will need to wiggle it around a bit, tricking the frog into 
thinking it's alive. Use a wooden spoon (for example) to move the mouse since a 
hungry frog could mistake your fingers for a tasty morsel and bite you instead 
of the intended mouse. Try not to put rocks in your frogs home since he may 
inadvertently eat one along with his crickets which will create dire 
circumstances for your frog! </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeding 
schedules can be trial and error. Sometimes your frog will catch his food 
immediately and other times he seems not at all interested. Just like us. Give 
him a few crickets and see how he responds. If he gobbles them up, give him a 
few more and so on. Don't throw massive amounts of food at your frog or he could 
be overwhelmed and lose his appetite. After you've had your frog for a while, 
you'll get to know how much and how often. Some frogs will tend to &quot;hibernate&quot; 
in the winter months and during this time will refuse to eat or eat very little.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your frog is 
your pet like a cat or dog or bird would be, and his health should be as 
important to you. Sometimes captivity is hard on a frog and he also could be 
prone to ailments not found in his native habitat. Some frogs will never adapt 
but most frogs will thrive with your tender loving care. Getting to know your 
frog's habits and observing him regularly will alert you to any problems he may 
have. A sick or injured frog should be attended to promptly since frogs have a 
habit of going &quot;downhill&quot; rather quickly. It is in the best interest of your 
frog to have a &quot;frog doctor&quot; who you can call on for just these situations. Some 
veterinarians will treat frogs and some specialize in exotic pets which a frog 
is considered to be. After bringing your frog home, ask your frog doctor if he 
wants to examine him. No, he won't get<img border="0" src="images/j0137143[1].gif" width="100" height="89" align="right"> shots like puppies and kittens but he can 
be tested for parasites (very common) and de-wormed just like puppies and 
kittens. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#99CCFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to 
putting a new frog into a tank with frogs already residing there, it's a good 
idea to isolate the new frog in another tank for about 2 weeks to make sure he 
is healthy and won't infect the others with some nasty disease. Taking your frog 
to the vet can of course be an expense you weren't planning on when you brought 
your frog home. But if you want a happy healthy frog who will amuse you for many 
years, it's not that costly to keep your frog well.</font></b></p>
