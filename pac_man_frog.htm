Just like the Pyxie frog, this frog can get quite big and while he appears cute 
as the dickens, could give you a bite should you not exercise caution during 
feedings. The Ornate or horned frogs (horn like projections over eyes), are 
commonly referred to as Pac man frogs because of their propensity to &quot;gobble&quot; up 
anything that moves. You do remember that game, don't you? As a result, these frogs should also have separate quarters 
since a smaller room mate will not be spared. Raul is so named because these frogs are 
native to South America so he needed a Latin name. Raul is considered an albino because he is red-orange 
where he would ordinarily be green. Their colors and markings vary from 
blue/aqua and beige to the common green.</font></b></p>

Crickets and mice are favorite foods for these frogs. The technique is the same 
as for Pyxies. Be careful! Use a wooden spoon (for example) to wiggle the 
defrosted mouse so your frog believes the mouse is alive. If it wiggles, it must 
be alive, therefore fresh. Frog's way of thinking, I guess.</font></b></p>

Raul resides in a 10 gallon tank with indoor 
outdoor carpeting, a bowl just his size and a &quot;toad&quot; house. ( says 
&quot;toad house&quot; over the door). Raul adores his toad house and hides in it all the 
time unless he is bathing. In the winter months when the temperature is cool, a 
light during the day will make your frog feel toasty warm. A UV light provides 
&quot;sunlight&quot; necessary to metabolize Calcium unless your frog gets to bask in 
actual sunlight periodically. And at night, plastic 
wrap keeps the heat in. These frogs, like Pyxies are easy to care for. Their 
needs are simple. A clean &quot;pond&quot;, a mouse now and then, lots of Calcium dusted 
crickets because these frogs are super prone to Calcium deficiencies, and a house to hide in makes them happy. A screen is usually not 
necessary since these frogs are not jumpers. However, if you have dogs or cats, it 
might be a good idea to prevent them from getting <i>in</i>.</font></b></p>

Chester is a new addition to the frog family. He is a Cranwell which is a type 
of horned frog. He is a baby and now only the size of a silver dollar. He was a 
rescue because he was a sick frog with metabolic bone disease. His bones were 
very soft and he couldn't eat well on his own. Baby frogs need proper nutrients 
just like human babies so they grow up healthy. He was given regular doses of 
Calcium and force fed. But he is now doing well and eating on his own and 
has quite an appetite so we're sure he won't be a little guy long! Chester 
enjoys his crickets, bathing and hanging out in his toad house and gets to bask 
in the sun now and then. And as you can see from the above picture of Chester, 
he likes to burrow in moss. So does Raul. These frogs don't go hunting. They 
wait patiently until the cricket or some other prey comes their way and then 
they grab it. No energy wasted that way!</font></b></p>
