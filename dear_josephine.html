Dear Millie,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should I feed my frog, whose name is Bruce.&nbsp; I 
never had a frog before. I gave him lots of lettuce and carrots but he won't eat 
them. I'm worried that he won't eat. Help!&nbsp; Bruce's human</p>

Dear Bruce's human,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course your frog won't eat! No self respecting frog 
likes lettuce and carrots! We frogs like to eat what bugs us. Get it? If your 
frog is dainty like me, he will love small crickets. If he is bigger, he will 
love bigger crickets or even mice. I know some frogs who eat worms too. Lay off 
the veggies and give him bugs!&nbsp; Love, Millie</p>

<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a very handsome frog. I live in a lovely 
swamp and have many bugs to eat. But I am very unhappy. You see, there is a 
lovely female amphibian named Lily that I am desperately in love with and I know 
we could be gloriously happy together and have hundreds and hundreds of handsome 
and lovely froglets together. However, Lily lives in another swamp and believe 
me, it is not half as nice as mine but she insists we live there. How can I 
convince her to move to my swamp and live happily ever after?&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob

<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure your swamp is very nice but it seems 
that Lily feels the same way about her swamp. Swamps are what you make them, 
you know. My suggestion to you is to go swamp hunting together until you&nbsp; 
find a swamp you can both agree on. Good luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millie</p>

<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Dear Millie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read your advice all the time. It has 
really helped me. But I now have a problem and I hope you can help. All my 
friends have a significant other except me. What's wrong? There are lots of 
frogs in the pond but I seem to only attract toads. Help! Lonely in big pond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Dear Lonely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You didn't mention if you are a frog or a 
toad. If you are a toad, maybe that's why you only attract toads. Look beyond 
the warts and I'm sure you will find your soul mate.&nbsp; Millie</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a human and I would love to have a red 
eyed tree frog just like you. Can you tell me where I can find another frog like 
you?&nbsp; Mike</p>
<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Dear Mike,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no other frog like me. So, I'm sorry 
to say, there will be no place I can refer you. However, if you will accept 
another red eye tree frog here are some links to search. And remember, Mike. All 
red eyes are great and I am sure the one you adopt will be just perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp;

the site. They have amphibians too. Go to the classifieds under amphibians or

Good luck.&nbsp; Millie</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get my human to pay more attention 
to me? He forgets to clean my bowl and I cannot bare to bathe in it sometimes. 
And I get very hungry but he forgets to give me crickets. I'm feeling weak and 
dirty. Desperate in Toledo</p>
<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Dear Desperate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try lying on your back. That should get his 
attention.&nbsp; If this doesn't work, you must escape from your tank. Call the 
ASPCF (American Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Frogs) and they will find a 
good home for you. Above all, don't croak!&nbsp;&nbsp; Millie</p>
