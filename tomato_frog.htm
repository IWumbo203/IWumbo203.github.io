frogs are really red orange! The truly red ones are from Madagascar while the 
domestically bred ones are lighter. They are nicknamed &quot;tomato&quot; frogs because of 
their color and they do look somewhat like fat little tomatoes. These little 
fellows are more a yellow color while babies and as they mature, they turn red. 
They are shy frogs and like to either burrow under moss or soft substrate or 
hide in a house. (sounds like every other frog.) They sneak out to bathe at 
night when no one is looking. When stressed, they exude a nasty sticky glue like 
substance which is a stinker to remove. It is not harmful but rather annoying. 
What predator wants to deal with that? </font> </font></b></font></p>

Tomas has settled in nicely. He even croaks now and then to let us know he is 
around. And for a little guy, he sure is loud! He doesn't seem to mind being out 
bathing at night as much as he did when he first arrived. Guess he figured out 
(like every other frog does eventually) I feed and take care of his needs so 
there is nothing to be afraid of. He is still a little shy but that might be 
just his personality or the nature of a Tomato frog. He even puts up with me 
picking him up now and then. Of course it's just for routine maintenance! Tomas 
is now learning the routine and becoming more relaxed and tolerant of me. These 
frogs like crickets and when larger will have an occasional mouse. Tomas is 
eating his crickets, bathing regularly and exhibiting normal frog behavior. 
Tomas gets up on the top of his house and surveys his kingdom. And from that 
vantage point, he can better see where his crickets are. </font></b></p>

Tomas has a girlfriend! Boy, is he happy! Her name is Tillie and only her legs 
are orange. Her body is yellow like an unripe tomato. Other than her color, she 
looks just like Tomas and acts like Tomas. She likes her back rubbed and will 
croak softly almost like she's purring. Tillie's picture will soon be here with 
Tomas' picture.</font></b></p>
